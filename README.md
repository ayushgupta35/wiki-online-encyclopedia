Wiki Online Encyclopedia Web App

This is a Wiki Online Encyclopedia Web Application developed using Python, Django, and other web technologies. The app aims to provide users with a platform to create, edit, and view articles on various topics, following a collaborative approach similar to Wikipedia.

Features

Home Page: The app's home page displays a list of available encyclopedia entries.
Entry Page: Each encyclopedia entry has its own dedicated page where users can view the article's content in HTML format. If an entry doesn't exist, an error page is shown.
Markdown-to-HTML Conversion: Articles can be written and edited using Markdown syntax. The app converts Markdown content to HTML for proper rendering.
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific entries. If a matching entry is found, users are redirected to its page. If not, search results are displayed, suggesting possible entries based on the search term.
New Entry Creation: Users can create new encyclopedia entries by providing a title and content in Markdown. If an entry with the same title exists, users have the option to edit it.
Edit Existing Entries: Users can edit existing entries by clicking on the "Edit" button. This takes them to the entry creation page with pre-filled content for editing.
Random Entry Generator: Users can explore a random encyclopedia entry by clicking the "Random" button, which redirects them to a randomly selected entry page.
